My solutions to CS50's Intro to AI

I created this repo to document my solutions to the [CS50 Intro to AI with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2023/) course. If you are a tudent taking this course, please do not simply copy and paste my solutions. This is a free online course, no one is compelling you take it. So please take it as a learning opportunity and write your solutions.

Screencasts of the scripts in action are uploaded [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQE3CwGWAdNFk000tAuNwwMfdiBnE75zB&si=9OBvBbJl8SfMJ7Sb).
